# Tesla Stock Price Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the stock prices of Tesla, Inc. using historical stock data. The project utilizes Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to perform data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. `prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the main codebase for data loading, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

## Data

The project uses the `tesla.csv` dataset, which contains historical stock data for Tesla, Inc., including the date, open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume.

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Open and run the `prediction.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Follow the instructions and code comments within the notebook to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and model training and evaluation.

## Code Structure

The key components of the code include:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization (line plots, box plots)
- Data preprocessing (scaling, splitting into train and test sets)
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation (R-squared, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error)

## Files

- `tesla.csv`: The dataset containing historical stock data for Tesla, Inc.
- `Google_test_data.csv`: Test data for Google (if applicable)
- `Google_train_data.csv`: Training data for Google (if applicable)
- `google.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for Google stock analysis (if applicable)

## Folder Structure

- `images`: Generated visualizations during data exploration and analysis (if applicable).
